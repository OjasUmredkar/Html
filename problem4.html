                Polymer, any of a class of natural or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/synthetic" style="color: blue;">synthetic</a>  substances composed of very large molecules,
                called macromolecules, that are multiples of simpler chemical units called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/monomer" style="color: blue;">monomersc</a>.
                Polymers make up many of the materials in living organisms, including, for example, proteins, cellulose, and nucleic acids.
                Moreover, they constitute the basis of such minerals as diamond, quartz, and feldspar and such man-made materials as concrete, glass, paper, plastics, and rubbers.</div>

                The word polymer designates an unspecified number of monomer units. When the number of monomers is very large, the compound is sometimes called a high polymer.
                Polymers are not restricted to monomers of the same chemical composition or molecular weight and structure. Some natural polymers are composed of one kind of monomer.
                Most natural and synthetic polymers, however, are made up of two or more different types of monomers; such polymers are known as copolymers.

                <h2>Natural polymers: organic and inorganic</h2>




                Organic polymers play a crucial role in living things, providing basic structural materials and participating in vital life processes.
                For example, the solid parts of all plants are made up of polymers.
                These include cellulose, lignin, and various resins. Cellulose is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/polysaccharide" style="color: blue;">polysaccharide</a>, a polymer that is composed of sugar molecules.
                Lignin consists of a complicated three-dimensional network of polymers.
                Wood resins are polymers of a simple hydrocarbon, isoprene. Another familiar isoprene polymer is rubber.

            <div vsapce="20px">
                Other important natural polymers include the proteins, which are polymers of amino acids, and the nucleic acids, which are polymers of nucleotides—complex molecules
                composed of nitrogen-containing bases, sugars, and phosphoric acid.
                The nucleic acids carry genetic information in the cell. Starches, important sources of food energy derived from plants, are natural polymers composed of glucose.

                Many <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/inorganic-polymers-1462212" style="color: blue;">inorganic polymers</a> also are found in nature, including diamond and graphite. Both are composed of carbon.
                In diamond, carbon atoms are linked in a three-dimensional network that gives the material its hardness.
                In graphite, used as a lubricant and in pencil “leads,” the carbon atoms link in planes that can slide across one another.

                <h2>Synthetic polymers</h2>
                Synthetic polymers are produced in different types of reactions. Many simple hydrocarbons, such as ethylene and propylene, can be transformed into polymers by adding one monomer after another to the growing chain.
                Polyethylene, composed of repeating ethylene monomers, is an addition polymer. It may have as many as 10,000 monomers joined in long coiled chains. Polyethylene is crystalline, translucent, and thermoplastic—i.e., it softens when heated.
                It is used for coatings, packaging, molded parts, and the manufacture of bottles and containers.
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/polypropylene" style="color: blue;">Polypropylene</a> is also crystalline and thermoplastic but is harder than polyethylene. Its molecules may consist of from 50,000 to 200,000 monomers.
                This compound is used in the textile industry and to make molded objects.

                If one hydrogen atom in ethylene is replaced by a chlorine atom, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/vinyl-chloride" style="color: blue;">vinyl chloride</a> is produced.
                This polymerizes to polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a colourless, hard, tough, thermoplastic material that can be manufactured in a number of forms, including foams, films, and fibres.
                Vinyl acetate, produced by the reaction of ethylene and acetic acid, polymerizes to amorphous, soft resins used as coatings and adhesives.
                It copolymerizes with vinyl chloride to produce a large family of thermoplastic materials.

                Many important polymers have oxygen or nitrogen atoms, along with those of carbon, in the backbone chain. Among such macromolecular materials with oxygen atoms are polyacetals.
                The simplest polyacetal is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/polyformaldehyde" style="color: blue;">polyformaldehyde</a>. It has a high melting point and is crystalline and resistant to abrasion and the action of solvents. Acetal resins are more like metal
                than are any other plastics and are used in the manufacture of machine parts such as gears and bearings.
                A linear polymer characterized by a repetition of ester groups along the backbone chain is called a polyester. Open-chain polyesters are colourless, crystalline, thermoplastic materials.
                Those with high molecular weights (10,000 to 15,000 molecules) are employed in the manufacture of films, molded objects, and fibres such as Dacron.
